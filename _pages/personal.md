Miscellaneous
======
* The Purpose of this Website
  * My background differs from that of typical computer science students, so I will introduce myself through this website (When I first encountered the terms 'monad' and 'type theory' during my junior year at university, I initially associated them with Leibniz and Russell&#128579; The former has little to do with Leibniz, while the latter was conceived by Russell). Although I also love alone time, as an ambivert, I really enjoy interacting with other people as well. I hope this site, which I created for the first time, will help me to interact with various people in graduate school.
    
* What I believe is important
  * The various experiences of the last year have made me believe that while knowledge and skills are important, emotional and social intelligence may be even more crucial in conducting research. This includes respecting others, asking for help, maintaining intellectual independence, making a continuous effort, being self-motivated, having a positive attitude, and being adaptable to change. 

* Quotes
  * [D]o not follow in my footsteps or in the footsteps of anybody else. Rather make a path of your own choosing, in directions which interest you most at the time. If you feel most comfortable with the established curriculum or the conventional career, I wish you the best of success in it. But if your interests or opportunities lead you in unusual directions, do not be afraid to stray from the general norm. If you think hard how to generalize your earlier learning and experiences, you will profit from them in the most unexpected ways. Everyone in this wide world has a different variety that we all need to foster and develop, to ensure the continued progress of human knowledge, the continuous renewal of our various cultures, and the ultimate prosperity and happiness of our human race.
(Tony Hoare, “Stories from a Life in Interesting Times”, 2001)
  * Not only children, but people in general, and scientists in particular, quickly forget what it was like not to know what they now know. That is, once you've solved a problem, especially when the solution involved a new approach, it's difficult to think about the problem in the old way. What was once unknown has become obvious. What once tested the ingenuity of the skilled practitioner is now "an exercise left to the student". (Michael S. Mahoney, “What Makes History?”, 1996)
  * L. Wittgenstein: “A person caught in a philosophical confusion is like a man in a room who wants to get out but doesn’t know how. He tries the window but it is too high. He tries the chimney but it is too narrow. And if he would only *turn around*, he would see that the door has been open all the time!” (Norman Malcolm, *Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir*, 2001, p.44)
  * All the time you're saying to yourself, "I could do that, but I won't" -- which is just another way of saying that you can't. (Richard Feynman, *Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!*, 1985, p.33)
