Hi there! I'm a technical assistant at the [National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics](https://www.ninjal.ac.jp/english/) (NINJAL&#129399;). Previously, I was a research student in [the Department of Mathematical and Computing Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/is/eng/) at the [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en) in Japan. Before joining Science Tokyo, I majored in History and Philosophy of Science and minored in Computer Science at [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/). I will begin my graduate studies in computer science in 2026. Here is my [CV](http://yudaiurabe.github.io/files/202510_YudaiUrabe_CV.pdf).\\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My interests lie in Programming Languages (PL) and in applying PL theories and techniques, such as program semantics and compiler design, to other areas, like natural language. Specifically, I am interested in revealing properties common to various kinds of languages through the lens of programming languages. These properties are related to naming, scope, the correspondence between symbols and meanings, and translation. My research focuses on the static analysis, partial evaluation, and the syntax-semantics interface. Ultimately, I aim to bridge the gap between programming languages and (written) natural languages - to formally translate natural languages into functional programming languages while preserving meaning(See also [EWD667](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html)). I believe this will reduce errors in programs and lead to more secure and reliable systems and society in the long run.
