Hi there! I'm a research student in [the Department of Mathematical and Computing Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/is/eng/) at the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04) in Japan (*Please note that the university will be renamed [the Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en) on October 1, 2024). Before joining Tokyo Tech, I majored in History and Philosophy of Science and minored in Computer Science at [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/). I'm applying to graduate programs in computer science for the 2025 cycle. Here is my [CV](http://yudaiurabe.github.io/files/202506_YudaiUrabe_CV.pdf).\\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am currently interested in Programming Languages (PL) and in applying PL theories and techniques to other areas, like natural language. It seems to me that the difference between natural and artificial languages (like programming languages) is not that big. So, I believe that program semantics and compiler techniques, for example, are useful for understanding some linguistic phenomena. Outside of my current research on static analysis, I enjoy reading about the philosophy of language and natural language semantics. My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between programming languages and (written) natural languages - to __formally__ translate natural languages into functional programming languages while preserving meaning. I believe this will reduce errors in programs and lead to more secure and reliable systems and society in the long run.
