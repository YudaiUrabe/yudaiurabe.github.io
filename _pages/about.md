Hi there! I'm a technical assistant at the [National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics](https://www.ninjal.ac.jp/english/) (NINJAL). Previously, I was a research student in [the Department of Mathematical and Computing Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/is/eng/) at the [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en) in Japan. Before joining Science Tokyo, I majored in History and Philosophy of Science and minored in Computer Science at [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/). I will begin my graduate studies in Computer Science at the University of Tsukuba in April 2026. Following my advisor’s retirement, I am scheduled to transfer to another institution after two years, and looking for a new place. Here is my CV(to be updated soon!).\\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My interests lie in the theoretical and human aspects of programming languages. Regarding the former, I am particularly interested in the semantics of languages, and I aim to narrow the gap between natural language and high-level programming languages. Recently, I have been exploring ways to prove useful properties of natural languages using insights from metaprogramming and natural language semantics. Partial results on this topic will be presented in March 2026. As for the latter, I am especially interested in the history of computing in the 1960s. I am currently engaged in the translation of papers that are to be published in November 2026.
