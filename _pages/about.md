Hi there! I'm a technical assistant at the [National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics](https://www.ninjal.ac.jp/english/) (NINJAL). Previously, I was a research student in [the Department of Mathematical and Computing Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/is/eng/) at the [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en) in Japan. Before joining Science Tokyo, I majored in History and Philosophy of Science and minored in Computer Science at [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/). I will begin my graduate studies in computer science in 2026. Here is my CV.\\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My interests lie in the theoretical and human aspects of programming languages. Specifically, I am aiming to narrow the gap between natural language and high-level programming languages using insights from partial evaluation and natural language semantics. I am currently concentrating on the translation of papers.
